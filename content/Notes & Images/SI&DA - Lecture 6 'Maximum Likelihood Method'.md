The maximum likelihood estimator searches for the max value of the **pdf** function $f_Y^{\theta}(y)$ where $\theta$ is our **parameter** to be estimated, we have said that $\theta$ is also equal to the mean of this **pdf** which is also equal to its max value, here's way the **ML Estimator**.

###### ~Ex.:
$Y_i$ should be $Y$ we consider only 1 Gaussian pdf.
$n$ : number of observation.
$y_i$ : $i$-esim observation.
