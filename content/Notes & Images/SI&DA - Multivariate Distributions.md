To know everything about a multivariate distribution model we also need every possible [[P&S - Definition of 'Combinations'|combination]] of its [[SI&DA - Definition of 'Joint CDF'|joint CDFs]] :
-> In the particular case of 2 distributions as seen above, to have a complete model we still need the joint CDF $F_{x_1, \kern 2px x_2}(x_1, \kern 2px x_2)$.
