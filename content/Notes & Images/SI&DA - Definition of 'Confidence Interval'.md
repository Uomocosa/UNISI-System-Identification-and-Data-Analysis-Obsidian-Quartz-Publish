### Definition of 'Confidence Interval'
#SIandDA #Definition 

Given a RV: $X$ with [[SI&DA - Mean & Variance|mean]] $E[X] = m_x$ and [[SI&DA - Mean & Variance|variance]] $\sigma_x$ we define the **$k$ - confidence interval$** (:= $\alpha_k$) as:

As we can see for the [[SI&DA - Gaussian Random Variables|Gaussian Distribution]] we can say that the 3-confidence interval is over 99%
-> This means that we are 99.7% sure that an observation of this Random Process will fall into the 3 interval range centred in the mean of the process ($m_x$)
