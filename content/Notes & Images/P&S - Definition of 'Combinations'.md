It can be surprisingly difficult to count the number of sequences or sets satisfying certain conditions. For example, consider a bag of marbles in which each marble is a different color. If we draw marbles one at a time from the bag without replacement

==How many different unordered sets (combinations)?==

- 1 Marble ($r$ : number of choosing objects from the set)
- 1 Color ($n$ : total number of objects in the set)
-> $_n C_r$ : number of combinations = 1

- 1 Marble, 4 Colours -> 4 Combinations
- 2 Marble, 4 Colours -> 6 Combinations
- 1 Marble, 4 Colours -> 4 Combinations
- 1 Marble, 4 Colours -> 1 Combinations
