###### Introduction
If the matrices that form the model $\mathcal{M}(A, B, C, G, Q, R)$ are **Time-Invariant** (none of them depends on $t$, the matrices are constants), then we can say that, for $t \to \infty$ we have some interesting properties, in an example we have seen that with a **LTI** model the matrices $P$ and $K$ (that are modified at each iteration of the **KF Algorithm**) reach very soon a condition of stability.
