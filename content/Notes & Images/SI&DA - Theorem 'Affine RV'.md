# Theorem 'Affine RV'
#SIandDA #Theorem #Demonstration

![[Pasted image 20220411110159.png]]
Where:
-> $m$ is the [[SI&DA - Mean & Variance|mean]] of $X$
-> $P$ is the [[SI&DA - Mean & Variance|variance]] of $X$

> **NOTE**:
> This is also true for $Y = AX + b$ even if $X$ is **not** Gaussian, still the affine RV $Y$ will be a [[SI&DA - Gaussian Random Variables|Gaussian Distribution]]
